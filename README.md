# Coindex
The goal of this project is to take advantage of API-driven trading available on BitMEX and other platforms, and execute automated trades based on indicator behavior from TradingView. 
This project is initially based off the sample Market Maker Bot available on the BitMEX Github, with additional code added to provide indication data from Tradingview, and additional code to execute more complex trading strategies and actions beyond basic market making.
