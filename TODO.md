# TODO

## Bot code base
* [Reconfigure order pattern to more heavily favor the price indicated by analysis](#1)
* Update a graph per iteration run showing the data it's using for analysis
* Persist settings to database so not dependent on config files

## DevOps
* Deploy bot to cloud compute instances
* Multi-bot deploy where bots can be started and stopped via database control
