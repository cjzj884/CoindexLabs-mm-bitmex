# TODO

## Bot code base
* Calculate return on equity for open position and install safety nets for exiting at certain percentages
* Update a graph per iteration run showing the data it's using for analysis
* Analyze past orders to show profitability
* Persist settings so not dependent on config files
* Web admin site for changing bot settings and viewing progress

## DevOps
* Deploy bot to cloud compute instances
* Multi-bot deploy where bots can be started and stopped via database control
